This purpose is to help me stay organized navigating the files and stuffs. 

So here is the deal: 

* Procfile houses the terminal gunicorn command to run our python server as soon as the content is loaded onto a server. 

* requirements.txt, as you can guess, has the pre-reqs to be downloaded on a new server for the application to function correctly.  these are the dependencies. 

* StaticHelper helps serve static content (think images, js files, json files, videos, this kind of thing)

* Dynamic Helper serves the html content.  it specifically looks for a <template> tag and fills in the content from the file extension.

* Files for the pages that a user sees are in the static folder

* Canvas is the real core of the product.  Other folders that live on the same level of Canvas will be things like "User Management" or "About Us"

* Within any folder in static, there is a folder for CSS files, JS files, and static assets.  

* Any complicated subcontrollers (like the toolbox or soemthing) can have a subfolder inside the parent to keep all the content together. 

* the toolbox prefix is for the toolbox that we ultimately want to roll out to.

* toolbox_light prefix is for the v0 toolbox with a wildly lightweight setup. Rules here: 
    1. Form Controls Available
    2. Drag and Drop is possible
    3. Everything is absolutely positioned (so nothing can be responsive in v0.  It will look great on just your machine)
    4. No Parenting.  Body is the only parent.  And everything else is a child of body.  Body has no grand-children. (this one is tentative)
